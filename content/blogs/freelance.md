description: "Freelance work has offered me the chance to explore areas of research, content creation, and more that have expanded my knowledge base and professional experience. My work has appeared on sites such as Baseball Prospectus, Splinter News, and at Sabermetrics, Scouting, and the Science of Baseball, a weekend seminar featuring research from around the sport of baseball. Additionally, I have provided freelance social media and marketing services for a variety of small business clients, most recently Lazy Cat Yarn and Baseball Prospectus."
